###Purpose

The purpose of the UFS workflows sandbox (hereafter referred to as “the sandbox”) is 1) to bring together common workflow tools and source codes into a single location for the purpose of facilitating workflow development in the UFS by project team members and relevant community partners; and 2) to provide a collection point for requirements for the UFS hurricane application workflow in particular and other UFS application workflows in general.
